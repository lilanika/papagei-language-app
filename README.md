## :bird::speech_balloon:PAPAGEI -  MERN application to get into conversation with native speakers
### Build with React.js, NodeJS, MongoDB, Cloudinary during Ironhacks bootcamp
## The project -->  https://papagei-language-app.herokuapp.com/

After Oriane MAGNIN and I built Papagei during Ironhack Bootcamp using React, Express and MongoDB, I redesigned the MERN stack app and learned more about css grid and ui design. This is what came out of it! The website is responsive and the profiles have 3 different formats to fit any device.
